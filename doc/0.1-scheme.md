# General schematics of the processor #

The processor is implemented through a 6-stage pipeline. In this way, each stage is a totally independent block from the others and further modifications can be done easily in future versions.

The first stage, the *fetch* Stage, has the duty of autonomously manage the program counter (*PC*), and contains the *BPU* for predicting branch outcomes. The fetch stage also checks for the real branch outcomes and flushes the pipeline as necessary.

After the instructions have been fetched, they pass through the *decode* stage, which is contained into the *control unit* (*CU*), which generates the appropriate control signals for the subsequent pipeline stages.

The following stage is the *register file* (*RF*) stage, which reads the operands of the instruction as needed. After this, the instruction enters the *Execute* stage, in which the operands (either immediates or registers) enter the ALU, in which a result or a memory address is computed. This stage also takes advantage of the *forwarding unit*, which preserves the correct register values from previous operations if they still haven't been written to the register file at read time.

Exiting the ALU, the instruction passes through the *memory* stage, in which either the ALU result is stalled one cycle, or the actual memory operation is executed.

Finally, the *writeback* stage is reached, in which the write operations onto the register file are performed. This can mean a write of an arithmetic operation, of a read memory data, or of a return address (in case of a *jal* instruction).

The top-level schematics of the CPU is presented in figure [1].
