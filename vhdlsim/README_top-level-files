Files marked with 000 contain constants;
Files marked with 01 contain functions for debugging/simulation (e.g. "print") and some often-used math functions (e.g. base-2 log).
Files marked with 02 contain descriptions of some primitives used throughout the whole design (e.g. mux21).
Files marked with 03 and 04 contain more and more complex structural descriptions based on the primitives (and on other structural descriptions, e.g. accumulator is also based on RCA).
